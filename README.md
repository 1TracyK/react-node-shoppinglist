User Stories

This project is suited for individuals who enjoy being organized and making the
most of thier time by shopping efficiently, I use a digital
shopping list app. I find this really helpful since I can
never seem to keep up with a paper list.

As a student this project is very helpful in the learning process
while aiding in my knowledge of the server and client sides
of react and node.
